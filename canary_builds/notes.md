## Magisk (c1602d25) (19301)
- Get UID from data folder instead of parsing `packages.xml`, should simplify the process and prevent crashes
- Properly implement namespace isolation in MagiskSU

## Magisk Manager (80d834fb) (215)
I am fully aware The current version is a little buggy, but I don't have time to fix it now. If you can't live with it, temporarily downgrade to an older version or switch to stable Magisk Manager, it will still be compatible.
